# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7 Challenge 

## Overview of Analysis
Now that Bobby has proven he can work well with SQL files, we have been given two more assignments. The first assignment is to determine the number of retiring employees per title and the second assignment is to identify the employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. After determining the number of retiring employees and who is eligbible for the mentorship program, we have been tasked with presenting a written report that summarizes our analysis.  There are three specific deliverables for this report.

- Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
- Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
- Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis

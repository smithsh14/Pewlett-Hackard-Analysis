# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7 Challenge 

## Overview of Analysis
Now that Bobby has proven he can work well with SQL files, we have been given two more assignments. The first assignment is to determine the number of retiring employees per title and the second assignment is to identify the employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. After determining the number of retiring employees and who is eligbible for the mentorship program, we have been tasked with presenting a written report that summarizes our analysis.  There are three specific deliverables for this report.

- Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
- Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
- Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis

## Results
Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
Using the ERD created at the start of this project, we were able find the number of employees who are ready to retire from the company and get a total count of the employees per job title. 
Insert ERD PNG

o	After creating and running the Retirement Titles code, the table populated a total number of 133,776 employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. 

o	Once we excluded those employees who had already left the company and filtered for only the most recent title for each employee, we find a total of 90,398 employees are ready to retire.
Using this information, we were able sort by title only and retrieve a count of all the employees ready to retire per job title. See table below…
Insert Retiring Titles Table
o	From this table we can see a high number of employees are ready to retire (90,398 employees) with the highest number of employees listed as “Staff” ready to retire than any other job title (32,452 employees or 35.90%). Employees with the job title of “Assistant Engineer” have the least number of employees ready to retire (1,761 employees or 19.48%). 
Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
For this task in the assignment, we created a mentorship-eligibility table that holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.
Below you will find the table created of all current employees born in 1965

o	Based on the data retrieved, we find there are 1,940 employees born in 1965 and who are eligible for the mentorship program
ANALYSIS
Our manager is concerned and preparing for the expected “silver tsunami” which is the term used to describe the first wave of ‘baby boomers’ who are reaching the age of retirement and will soon be making an exit out of the workforce. To assist the manager in preparing for this he has posed two specific questions for us to answer using the data we have been able to analyze. 
•	How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
o	There are 90,398 employees who are ready to retire. Each of those roles will need to be filled as those who are ready to retire begin to exit the workforce. 
•	Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
o	There are only 1,940 employees who are eligible for the mentorship program. With only a small amount of the employees eligible for mentorship there will be a gap in leadership/upper management positions that will need to be filled to bridge the gap that will be left as more of the older generation retires.

Additional Research
-	As the manager continues to prepare for the “silver tsunami”, additional data analysis can be used to provide further insight into the dynamics of the company. Using the information provided in the Unique Titles table information can be teased out to review and answer the following questions…
o	What is the gender breakdown among those employees who are ready to retire?
o	What is the impact the salary difference will have on the company after those who are ready to retire exit the workforce?
o	Which department(s) will be impacted the most by those who are ready to retire?
